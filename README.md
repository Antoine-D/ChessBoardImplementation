# ChessBot
Very simple multithreaded java chess bot

##TODO:
* Make board game state static
    * Make current turn field to keep track of whose turn it is
    * list of all pieces for each color and whether they are alive or not
* each piece needs to have access to the board state because pawns need to know whether there are pieces diagnol to it so it can know wheter it can move diagonally.
